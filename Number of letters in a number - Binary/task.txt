Find the nth term in the sequence starting with S(0) = start and defined by the rule:

Given a term in the sequence, S(i), the next term, S(i+1) can be found by counting the letters
(ignoring whitespace) in the spelled-out binary representation of S(i).

As an example, starting from 5 (S(0) = 5), we convert to the binary representation,
101, then spell it out as an English string "one zero one", and count the letters which yields 10 (S(1) = 10).
